          </div>
          <p className="lead mt-3">
            What we eat doesn't just fuel our bodyâ€”it also shapes our mood,
            memory, and focus. Research shows balanced nutrition helps reduce
            anxiety, depression, and brain fog. Nutrition is more than just

          <p className="lead mt-3">
            Just like exercise strengthens the body, nutrition strengthens the
            mind. Making mindful food choices can be a powerful step toward
            resilience, clarity, and emotional balance.
